## Count reactions real time with custom images
Ideal if you want to do a voting style post with reactions.
<ul>
<li>1. Add your access token to assets/js/config.js</li>
<li>2. Find your Page id using: http://findfacebookid.com/</li>
<li>3. Get your post id</li>
<li>4. Add your post id to assets/js//config.js</li>
<li>5. Update the placeholder images with your own images</li>
<li>6. Run imageAndReaction.html in browser </li>
</ul>

<p>You can remove the cards you don't need so that you are only left with the reactions you want.</p>
<p>e.g if you are only using two images to vote and want to use 'wow' and 'haha' then remove all the other divs but those two and they will continue to update on the page as normal.</p>
<p>Any overflow of the image will be cropped to keep the card looking nice</p>
